NEUBIAS activities are spiraling around bioimage analysis “**workflows**”. Since this term is often used in slightly different ways by each person, we clarify the definition of “**workflow**” used in the NEUBIAS community in the following article.  While doing so we also introduce the related activities organized by NEUBIAS.

Software packages such as ImageJ, MATLAB, CellProfiler or ICY are often used to analyze bioimages. These software packages are “**collections**” of image processing and analysis algorithms. Although their distribution and the way to access their resources is different since they can come with or without Graphical User Interface (GUI), as libraries such as ImgLib2, OpenCV, ITK, VTK, and Scikit-Image; we invariably refer to them as “**collections**”. To actually analyze bioimage data scientifically and address an underlying biological problem, one needs to hand pick some algorithms from these **collections**, carefully adjust their functional parameters to the problem and assemble them in a meaningful order. Such a sequence of image processing algorithms with a specified parameter set is what we call a “Workflow”. The implementations of the algorithms that are used in the **workflows** are the “**components**” constituting that workflow (or “**workflow components**”). From the point of view of the expert who needs to assemble a workflow, a collection is a package bundling many different **components**. Many plugins offered for ImageJ are mostly also **collections** (e.g. Trackmate, 3D Suite, MOSAIC…), as they bundle implementations of related algorithms.

Each **workflow** is uniquely associated with a specific biological research project because the question asked therein and the acquired image quality is often unique. This leads to a unique combination of **components** and parameter set. Some **collections**, especially those designed with GUI, offer **workflow templates**. These templates are pre-assembled sequences of image processing tasks to solve a typical bioimage analysis problem; all one needs to do is to adjust the parameters of each step. For example, in the case of Trackmate plugin for ImageJ, a GUI wizard guides the user to choose an algorithm for each step among several candidates and also to adjust their parameters to achieve a successful particle tracking **workflow**.  When these algorithms and parameters are set, the **workflow** is built. CellProfiler also has a helpful GUI that assists the user in building a **workflow** based on **workflow templates**, that allows the user to easily swap the algorithms for each step and test various parameter combinations.

Though such templates are available for some typical tasks, **collections** generally do not provide helpful clues to construct a **workflow** – how and in which order the **components** should be assembled depends on expert knowledge, empirical knowledge or testing. Since the biological questions are so diverse, the **workflow** often needs to be original and might not match any available **workflow templates**. Building a **workflow** from scratch needs some solid knowledge about the **components** and the ways to combine them. It also needs an understanding of the biological problem itself. Each **workflow** is in essence associated with a specific biological question, and this question and the image acquisition setup affect the required precision of the analysis. In some cases, a higher precision does not imply more meaningful results, this should be carefully planned together with the statistical treatment (which also affect to some extent the choice of the **components**). Figure 1 summarizes the above explanations.
